<h1 align="center">Revenue Metrics for Video Game Sales (Mar-Dec 2022)</h1>

## 📝 Project description

The project concerns the revenue generated from video games sales between March and December 2022. It will enable product managers to track the dynamics of revenue changes and analyse the factors influencing these revenues.

## 🎯 Goals

✅ Calculating financial metrics – Analysing MRR, new users, churned users, and their impact on overall revenue

✅ User segmentation – Grouping players based on age, language, payment history

✅ Identifying market trends – Detecting purchasing patterns and user preferences based on sales data

✅ Analysing factors influencing revenue – Identifying key elements such as user count, payments

✅ Optimizing business strategy – Helping product managers make decisions regarding pricing and marketing budget allocation

✅ Visualization of project results as a interactive dashboard

## 💡 Results and conclusions

✅ Between March and December 2022, the total revenue from video game sales amounted to $63,141. During this period, 383 users made a purchase, generating an average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) of $165

✅ Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) grew steadily from $1,491 in March to $9,344 in October. In November and December, it dropped slightly to $8,425 and $8,440. During the same time, the number of active users increased from 43 in March to 189 in December, showing that more users were joining each month

✅ Game 3 was the most popular, purchased by 373 users and generating $62,850 in revenue. Game 1 had the lowest sales, with only 3 users and $69 in revenue. This may indicate a lack of market fit or insufficient marketing

✅ The highest revenue came from users aged 19–23 ($22,798) and 14–18 ($19,272), while the lowest came from the 34–44 age group (only $2,435). The 14–23 age group accounts for 67% of total revenue, making it a key target segment

✅ September recorded the highest user retention in the first month after initial payment — 78.9%. A similarly high rate was observed in June — 77.8%. The lowest retention was seen in April, with only 22% of users remaining active in the eighth month after their first payment

✅ In November, the highest churned revenue was recorded, caused by the loss of 71 users, resulting in $2,800 in lost income. However, new users and extra payments from existing ones (Expansion MRR) helped keep total revenue steady.
